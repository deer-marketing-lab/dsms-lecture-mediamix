# Measuring Advertising Response

`r icons:::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("bullseye", style = "solid"), scale = 1)`
**The goal of any marketing campaign is to increase sales** 

* Either short-term or long-term

`r icons:::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid"), scale = 1)`
**How to evaluate the performance of marketing?**

Each campaign / channel evaluated on incremental profit that it produces relative to its cost 

$$
ROI = \frac{\text{incremental profit due to advertising} - \text{cost of advertising}}{\text{cost of advertising}}
$$

# The What & Why of Media Mix Modelling?

---
class: font160
# What is Media Mix Modelling?

According to [Marketing Evolution](https://www.marketingevolution.com/marketing-essentials/media-mix-modeling):

<br>
<br>

> An **analysis technique** that allows marketers to **measure the impact** of their **marketing and advertising campaigns** to determine how various elements contribute to their goal, which is often to drive conversions (sales)

<br>
<br>

.center[That sounds a lot like Attribution Modelling!]

---
class: font160
# What is Media Mix Modelling?

A more workable definition:

> Aims to **measure the correlation between total sales** in each day/week/month **and advertising spending or impressions** on that same day/week/month

Key Differences to Attribution Modelling:

* Uses aggregate data
* Longer time horizon in the analysis (months vs weeks)
* Wider range of channels, both traditional and digital
* Incorporate *external influences* such as seasonality, promotions 
* Modelling done "less often"

# The Business Problem

**Seeking Answers to the following Strategic Questions:**

1. How does a firm's marketing activities correlate to a KPI of interest? 
2. What is the optimal mix of marketing activities for a given KPI?

**Data Driven Approach**:

1. Media Mix Modelling (MMM)
  - Estimate how different marketing activities impact a KPI
  - How? Via Linear Regression
2. Media Mix Optimization (MMO)
  - Adjust budget allocation across marketing activities to optimize a KPI of interest


Discussion Q: Could you do this without data?

# Media Mix Models vs Attribution

**Attribution Modelling:** 

* Bottoms up 
* Individual user data 
* Granular planning and optimization

**Media Mix Modelling:**

* Top down 
* Time Series data 
* Can account for offline variables
* Low frequency planning and optimization

# CAUTION: Media Mix vs Marketing Mix

**Media Mix Modelling**

* Seeks to understand the role each media type plays in driving the overall campaign performance. 

**Marketing Mix Modelling**:

* Take a more holistic view. 
* It doesn't just consider media channels but also factors in other marketing activities 
  * Pricing strategies, product distribution, and even macroeconomic indicators. 
* About viewing the larger picture and determining how these varying elements interplay to impact the overall marketing performance.

# Simple Linear Regression: Explaining

Discussion Questions:

* Why is this regression line the "right" one?

* Can we explain each part of the statistical output?

* Interpret the regression coefficients

* Does our regression line have any important properties?

# Logarithmic Transformations I

$$\log(Sales)_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 price_i + \varepsilon_i$$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tidy(lm(log(sales) ~ price, data = oj))
```

**Coefficient Interpretation** (in general): 

On average, a change in X by one unit, $\Delta X=1$, is associated with a $(\exp(\beta_1) - 1)*100$ % change in Y

* Remark: for small $\beta_1$, $(\exp(\beta_1) - 1) \approx \beta_1$ so often you will see an interpretation that reads straight from $\beta_1$ 

**Coefficient Interpretation** (this example): 

---
# Logarithmic Transformations II

$$\log(Sales)_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(price_i) + \varepsilon_i$$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tidy(lm(log(sales) ~ log(price), data = oj))
```

**Coefficient Interpretation** (in general): 

On average, a 1% change in X is associated with a change in $\beta_1$ % change in Y 
  * $\beta_1$ is the elasticity of Y with respect to X

# The MMM Problem 

Over-arching question: 

> **How does a firm's marketing activities impact sales?** 

Split into answer two sub-questions:

> (a) *What proportion of sales can be attributed to marketing activities?*

> (b) *How does each marketing channel contribute to sales?*

Note: 

* We are using *sales* as the KPI of interest 
* Others possible. Rarely used. Think about what they could be & why...

# MMM with Two Marketing Variables

Suppose only spend on YouTube Ads and TV Ads, KPI is Sales.

Then form a regression model:

\begin{equation}
\text{Sales}_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{YouTube Ad Spending}_t + \beta_2 \text{TV Ad Spending}_t + \varepsilon_{t}
\end{equation}

We can say that:

* $\beta_0$ is the **baseline revenue** 
* $\beta_1 \text{YouTube Ad Spending}$ is the **incremental revenue from YouTube Ad Spending**
* $\beta_2 \text{TV Ad Spending}$ is the **incremental revenue from TV Ad Spending**
* $\beta_1 \text{YouTube Ad Spending} + \beta_2 \text{TV Ad Spending}$ is the **incremental revenue from all marketing spending**

---
class: font140
# Simple Media Mix Model

Consider the Linear Regression with $m$ marketing activities:

\begin{equation}
Y_t = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=0}^{m} \beta_j X_{jt} + \varepsilon_{t}
\end{equation}

where: 

* $t$ is a unit of time (eg. week, month, etc)
* $Y_t$ is the KPI of interest (eg. Sales)
* $\beta_0$ is the regression intercept / baseline in MMM
* $X_j$ is the marketing spend for the $j$th marketing variable (eg. TV ads, Youtube Ads, Google Ads, etc)
* $\beta_j$ is the incremental effect of one unit of $X_jt$
* $m$ is the number of marketing variables 
* $\varepsilon_t$ is the modelling error, i.e difference between predicted and actual values of the KPI

# Interpreting the Simple Media Mix Model

# Mixed Models 

**Extending the Strategic Vision**:

> *What if we believe the incremental impact of different marketing activities differs across regions?*

Goal:

- Estimate an impact that is true on average across all regions 
- Estimate deviations from this average that are region specific

---
# A Two Activity, Two Region Mixed Model

Suppose only spend on YouTube Ads and TV Ads, KPI is Sales.

Two Regions: National data, want different effects for Chicago and San Francisco.

Form a regression model:

\begin{align}
\text{Sales}_{it} = \beta_0 &+ \underbrace{\beta_{1F} \text{YouTube Ad Spending}_{it} + \beta_{2F} \text{TV Ad Spending}_{it}}_{\text{Average Impacts}} \\
                            &+ \underbrace{\beta_{1\text{Chicago}} \text{YouTube Ad Spending}_{it} + \beta_{2\text{Chicago}} \text{TV Ad Spending}_{it}}_{\text{Chicago's Deviations}} \\
                            &+ \underbrace{\beta_{1\text{San Fran}} \text{YouTube Ad Spending}_{it} + \beta_{2\text{San Fran}} \text{TV Ad Spending}_{it}}_{San Franciso's Deviations} \\
                            &+ \varepsilon_{it}
\end{align}

Then: 

* Average Impacts: $\beta_{jF}$
* Chicago Impacts: $\beta_{jF}$ + $\beta_{j\text{Chicago}}$
* San Franciso Impacts: $\beta_{jF}$ + $\beta_{j\text{San Franciso}}$ 

$\implies$ data must be at the region level!

# Mixed Models: General Case 

Consider the Linear Regression with $m$ marketing activities and $i$ regions:

\begin{equation}
Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=0}^{m} \beta_{j} X_{ijt} + \sum_{j=0}^{m} \beta^{(i)}_{j} X_{ijt}  + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation}

where: 

* $t$ is a unit of time (eg. week, month, etc)
* $Y_{it}$ is the KPI of interest (eg. Sales in Chicago in March)
* $X_j$ is the marketing spend for the $j$th marketing variable (eg. TV ads, Youtube Ads, Google Ads, etc)
* $\beta_j$ is the average incremental effect of one unit of $X_{jt}$
* $\beta^{(i)}_j$ is the deviation from the average incremental effect of one unit of $X_{jt}$ in region $i$
* $\varepsilon_{it}$ is the modelling error, i.e difference between predicted and actual values of the KPI

---
class: font130
# Interpreting Mixed Models

Consider an example from the 2 marketing activity $\times$ 2 region model:

* $\hat{\beta}_1 = 0.5$, $\hat{\beta}_2 = 0.75$
* $\hat{\beta}^{\text{Chicago}}_1 = 0.5$, $\hat{\beta}^{\text{Chicago}}_2 = 0.25$
* $\hat{\beta}^{\text{SanFran}}_1 = -0.25$, $\hat{\beta}^{\text{SanFran}}_2 = -0.5$

What do these estimates mean?

# State Space Models 

**Extending the Strategic Vision** (again!):

> *What if we believe the incremental impact of different marketing activities also differs across time?*

Why would we want to do this?

Goal:

- Estimate an impact that is true on average across all regions and time periods
- Estimate deviations from this average that are region and time specific

---
class: font160
# State Space Models 

How to implement a state space model?

* It's still in linear regression 
* We need the regression coefficients, $\beta$'s, to vary across regions and over time 
* ... I'll leave out the math since it get's ugly 
* Data requirement: We need data on Y and X's to vary across regions and over time!

# Non-linear Effects in MMM

So far assumed:

- Only Spend in time period $t$ impacts KPI in $t$ 
- Marketing activities do not have a saturation effect

**These are strong assumptions!**

---
class: font160
# Non-linear Effects in MMM 

Can extend MMM to allow for:

* **Adstock** effects 
  - Marketing activities today can impact the future period KPI, but with less impact further into the future.
* **Saturation**
  - Marketing activities carry diminishing rates of return as spend increases
* **Lagged Effectiveness**
  - Consumers who view ads today may wait a few weeks to buy a product

# Media Mix Optimization

class: font140
# Media Mix Optimization Problem 

> **How to allocate a marketing budget over multiple channels?**

Assume there is one KPI we want to maximize (eg. Sales):

* MMM tells us how marketing activities impact a KPI of interest ...
  - ... and we can use it to predict the KPI for a given allocation of budget 

* **Media Mix Optimization**: Two steps (once we have estimated a MMM)
  - Simulate different budget allocations and their impact on a KPI, 
  - Choose the best allocation

* This is a constrained optimization problem
  - How to do this is beyond the scope of this class...
  - ... But the intuition is not

---
class: font160
# Media Mix Optimization 

The MMO problem:

\begin{align}
\max \quad &\text{Predicted Sales}_t \\
     &\text{subject to} \quad \text{Total Expenditure}_t \leq \text{Budget}_t
\end{align}

* Remark: Above is for a single unit of time
  - Often extend to set optimal strategy for multiple periods

---
class: font140
# Media Mix Optimization Example

In our simplest MMM problem:

\begin{align}
\max \quad &\hat{\text{Sales}_t} \\
     &\text{subject to} \quad \text{YouTube Ad Spending}_t + \text{TV Ad Spending}_t \leq \text{Budget}_t
\end{align}

Equivalently:

\begin{align}
\max \quad &\underbrace{\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \text{YouTube Ad Spending}_t + \hat{\beta_2} \text{TV Ad Spending}_t}_{\text{MMM Model}} \\
     &\text{subject to} \quad \text{YouTube Ad Spending}_t + \text{TV Ad Spending}_t \leq \text{Budget}_t
\end{align}

This can be solved on a computer!

class: font140
# MMM and Causality: Reflecting

Hard pressed to think of MMM in causal terms 

* Omitted / Lurking Variables 
* Marketing Spending is not "as good as random"

$\implies$ careful when interpreting outputs 

As a 'prediction' model this is OK ...

* And how I think about MMM, "can I predict sales with marketing activities"

But then, the coefficients don't have causal interpretations, so does MMO make sense?

$\implies$ it's a tricky space 

* Some recent developments trying to wrestle with this ...

---
class: font160
# Summary 

* Media Mix Modelling (MMM) relates a KPI (sales) to marketing activities over time 

* MMM can allow for effects of marketing to differ across regions and over time 

* Simplified MMM models can be extended to allow for non-linear effects that offer more 'realistic' assumptions on how marketing impacts a KPI

* Media Mix Optimization solves for optimal marketing budget allocation given the estimates from a MMM problem
