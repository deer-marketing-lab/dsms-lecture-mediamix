# Measuring Advertising Response

`r icons:::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("bullseye", style = "solid"), scale = 1)`
**The goal of any marketing campaign is to increase sales** 

* Either short-term or long-term

`r icons:::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid"), scale = 1)`
**How to evaluate the performance of marketing?**

Each campaign / channel is evaluated on incremental profit that it produces relative to its cost 

$$
ROI = \frac{\text{incremental profit due to advertising} - \text{cost of advertising}}{\text{cost of advertising}}
$$

# The What & Why of Media Mix Modelling

---
class: font160
# What is Media Mix Modelling?

According to [Marketing Evolution](https://www.marketingevolution.com/marketing-essentials/media-mix-modeling):

<br>
<br>

> An **analysis technique** that allows marketers to **measure the impact** of their **marketing and advertising campaigns** to determine how various elements contribute to their goal, which is often to drive conversions (sales)

<br>
<br>

.center[**That sounds a lot like Attribution Modelling :(**]

---
class: font160
# What is Media Mix Modelling?

A more workable definition:

> Aims to **measure the correlation between total sales/revenue** in each week/month **and advertising spending or impressions** on that same week/month

**Key Differences** to Attribution Modelling:

* Uses aggregate data
* Longer time horizon in the analysis (months vs weeks)
* Wider range of channels, both traditional and digital
* Incorporate external influences such as seasonality, promotions 
* Analysis done "less often"

# The Business Problem

**Seeking Answers to the following Strategic Questions:**

1. How does a firm's marketing activities correlate to a KPI of interest? 
2. What is the optimal mix of marketing activities for a given KPI?

**Data Driven Approach**:

1. Media Mix Modelling (MMM)
  - Estimate how different marketing activities impact a KPI
  - How? Via Linear Regression .font80[(or some other statistical model)]
2. Media Mix Optimization (MMO)
  - Adjust budget allocation across marketing activities to optimize a KPI of interest

# CAUTION: Media Mix vs Marketing Mix

**Media Mix Modelling**:

* Seeks to understand the role each media type plays in driving the overall campaign performance. 

**Marketing Mix Modelling**:

* Take a more holistic view. 
* It doesn't just consider media channels but also factors in other marketing activities 
  * Pricing strategies, product distribution, and even macroeconomic indicators. 
* About viewing the larger picture and determining how these varying elements interplay to impact the overall marketing performance.

# The Simple Media Mix Model

class: font160
# The MMM Problem 

Over-arching question: 

> **How does a firm's marketing activities impact revenue?** 

Split into answer two sub-questions:

(a) How does *each* marketing channel contribute to revenue?

(b) *What proportion of revenue can be attributed to marketing activities?*


.font70[
Notes: 

* We are using *revenue* as the KPI of interest 
* Others possible. Rarely used. Why?

# MMM with Two Marketing Variables

Suppose company only spends on Facebook Ads and TV Ads, KPI is weekly revenue.

Then write a regression model:

\begin{equation}
\text{Revenue}_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Facebook Ad Spending}_t + \beta_2 \text{TV Ad Spending}_t + \varepsilon_{t}
\end{equation}

We can say that:

* $\beta_0$ is the **baseline revenue** 
* $\beta_1 \text{Facebook Ad Spending}$ is the **additional revenue from Facebook Ad Spending**
* $\beta_2 \text{TV Ad Spending}$ is the **additional revenue from TV Ad Spending**
* $\beta_1 \text{Facebook Ad Spending} + \beta_2 \text{TV Ad Spending}$ is the **additional revenue from all marketing spending**

---
class: font120
# Interpreting the Simple Media Mix Model 

\begin{equation}
\text{Revenue}_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Facebook Ad Spending}_t + \beta_2 \text{TV Ad Spending}_t + \varepsilon_{t}
\end{equation}

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(broom)
media_mix <- read_csv("data/dt_simulated_weekly.csv")
options(scipen=999)

summary(lm(revenue/1e3 ~ I(facebook_S/1e3) + I(tv_S/1000), data = media_mix))
```

---
class: font140
# More Marketing Variables

Consider the Linear Regression with $m$ marketing activities:

\begin{equation}
\text{Revenue}_t = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=0}^{m} \beta_j X_{jt} + \varepsilon_{t}
\end{equation}

where: 

* $t$ is a unit of time (eg. week, month, etc)
* $Y_t$ is the KPI of interest (eg. Sales)
* $\beta_0$ is the regression intercept
* $X_{jt}$ is the marketing spend for the $j$th marketing variable (eg. TV ads, Facebook Ads, Google Search Ads, etc)
* $\beta_j$ is the incremental effect of one unit of $X_{jt}$
* $m$ is the number of marketing variables 
* $\varepsilon_t$ is the modelling error, i.e difference between predicted and actual values of the KPI

# More Marketing Variables: In Practice

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

summary(lm(revenue/1e3 ~ I(facebook_S/1e3) + I(tv_S/1000) + 
          I(search_S/1e3) + I(print_S/1e3), data = media_mix)

# Extending Media Mix Models I

class: font160
# Mixed Models 

**Extending the Strategic Vision**:

> *What if we believe the incremental impact of different marketing activities differs across regions?*

Goal:

- Estimate an impact that is true on average across all regions 
- Estimate deviations from this average that are region specific

$\implies$ We need data at the region level!

---
class: font140
# State Space Models 

**Extending the Strategic Vision**:

> *What if we believe the incremental impact of different marketing activities also differs across time?*

Goal:

- Estimate an impact that is true on average across all regions and time periods
- Estimate deviations from this average that are region and time specific

$\implies$ We need data on

* Revenue, and  
* Marketing Activities 

to vary across regions **and** over time!

**Remark:** the effectiveness of advertising is varying across region or time 

$\implies$ the regression coefficients vary 

$\implies$ this is **not** controlling for regional differences or seasonality

# Adding Control Variables

We can add extra variables to the model:

\begin{aligned}
\text{Revenue}_{it} = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=0}^{m} \beta_j X_{ijt} + \gamma Z_{ijt}  + \alpha_i + \tau_t + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{aligned}

where

* $Z_{ijt}$: other variables that influence revenue .font70[(and correlate with $X_{ijt}$)]

<br>

* $\alpha_i$: differences in level of revenue across region .font70[(that are constant over time)]

<br>

* $\tau_t$: seasonality $\rightarrow$ differences in level of sales across time  .font70[(that are the same for all regions)]

---
class: font140
# Adding Control Variables

We can add extra variables to the model:

\begin{aligned}
\text{Revenue}_{it} = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=0}^{m} \beta_j X_{ijt} + \gamma Z_{ijt}  + \alpha_i + \tau_t + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{aligned}

Why might we do this?

* Omitted Variable Bias 

<br>

* Better predictive ability

class: font160
# More Complex Effects of Advertising

So far assumed:

- "*Spending yesterday doesn't impact revenue today*"
  - Advertising spending in time period $t$ only impacts KPI in $t$


<br>

- "*Every dollar spent per channel is equally effective*"
  - Marketing activities do not have a non-linear effects on sales

<br>

# Media Mix Optimization

---
class: font160
# Media Mix Optimization Problem 

> **How to allocate a marketing budget over multiple channels?**

* Assume there is one KPI we want to maximize (eg. Revenue):

* We can *predict* revenue based on a media mix model 

* We have a fixed budget to allocate 

Simplification for today:

* We assume we want to maximize sales *this time period* only 
* By allocating spending across channels in this time period only
* Remark: Can be extended to set optimal strategy for multiple periods

---
class: font160
# Media Mix Optimization Problem

Think of **Media Mix Optimization** as a two step process

- Simulate different budget allocations and their impact on a KPI, 
- Choose the best allocation
- Assumes the media mix model that predicts revenue already exists

This is a constrained optimization problem

- How to do this is beyond the scope of this class...
- ... But the intuition is not

---
class: font160
# Media Mix Optimization 

The Media Mix Optimization problem:

\begin{align}
\max \quad &\text{Predicted Revenue}_t \\
     &\text{subject to} \quad \text{Total Expenditure}_t \leq \text{Budget}_t
\end{align}


---
class: font140
# Media Mix Optimization Example

Using our two marketing activity example:

\begin{align}
\max \quad &\hat{\text{Revenue}_t} \\
     &\text{subject to} \quad \text{Facebook Ad Spending}_t + \text{TV Ad Spending}_t \leq \text{Budget}_t
\end{align}

<br>

Equivalently:

\begin{align}
\max \quad &\underbrace{\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \text{Facebook Ad Spending}_t + \hat{\beta_2} \text{TV Ad Spending}_t}_{\text{MMM Model}} \\
     &\text{subject to} \quad \text{Facebook Ad Spending}_t + \text{TV Ad Spending}_t \leq \text{Budget}_t
\end{align}

# Recap

class: font160
# Media Mix vs Attribution Models

**Attribution Modelling:** 

* Bottom up 
* Individual user data 
* Digital advertising only
* High frequency planning

**Media Mix Modelling:**

* Top down 
* Time Series data 
* Can account for offline variables
* Low frequency planning and optimization


---
class: font140
# Deeper Reflections on MMM

**It's hard to think of Media Mix Models in causal terms** 

* Omitted / Lurking Variables 
* Marketing Spending is **not** randomly allocated

$\implies$ careful when interpreting outputs 

As a 'prediction' model this is OK ...

* And how I think about MMM, "can I predict sales with marketing activities"

But then, **the coefficients don't have causal interpretations**, so does MMO make sense?

$\implies$ it's a tricky space 

* Some recent developments trying to wrestle with this ... beyond our scope

---
class: font160
# Summary 

* Media Mix Modelling (MMM) relates a KPI (revenue) to marketing activities over time 

* MMM can allow for effects of marketing to differ across regions and over time 

* Simplified MMM models can be extended to allow for non-linear effects that offer more 'realistic' assumptions on how marketing impacts a KPI

* Media Mix Optimization solves for optimal marketing budget allocation given the estimates from a MMM problem
